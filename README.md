# Supermarket Code Kata

Your supermarket sells drinks, crisps and sandwiches.  It also offers a meal deal, where one of each items can be
purchased for Â£3.00.  You need to be able to calculate the price of a basket of items, based on the prices on the item
classes, and the special meal deal rule.

Implement the class `BasketPriceCalculator` to return the correct values.  The PHPSpec tests provided should pass when
you have done this correctly.
